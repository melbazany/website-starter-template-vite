## "Starter template" - WIP
- Creating SCSS base template for utilization as my own SCSS framework for
  future project build implementations. Using this exercise as a way to determine
  what other components would be of benefit to add to my existing template structure.
- Learning to generate my own independent utility classes, mixins, functions
  and media queries rather than relying on manipulating pre-built frameworks
  such as TailwindCSS (or Lord forbid, Bootstrap)
